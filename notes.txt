A simple web app with Blazor, a web framework enabling .NET to build interactive UI.

This app has been created with the following line:

    dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorApp --no-https -f net7.0


The following command builds and starts the app:

    dotnet watch


Some files in this directory:

• Program.cs is the entry point for the app that starts the server and where
you configure the app services and middleware.

• App.razor is the root component for the app.

• The Pages directory contains some example web pages for the app.

• BlazorApp.csproj defines the app project and its dependencies.

• The launchSettings.json file inside the Properties directory defines different
profile settings for the local development environment. A port number ranging
between 5000-5300 is automatically assigned at project creation and saved on this file.

Additional Notes:

• .razor files are for Razor markup syntax for embedding .NET based code into webpages.
